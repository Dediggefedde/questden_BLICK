## How to Install
Userscripts are basically little extensions for your browser.\
You will need to use a userscript manager to run scripts.\
I recommend [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).\
If you use Google Chrome, you will also need to [enable the extension developer mode](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q209).

Here is an install link:Â https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/522343-questden-blick2
Otherwise, you can view the file ["questden_blick2.user.js"](https://github.com/Dediggefedde/questden_BLICK/raw/refs/heads/main/questden_blick2.user.js?raw=true) from the list above.

Confirm the prompt from Tampermonkey that you want to install the script and reload questden.org. Then the script is ready to run and will show a small blue button on the right.

To check whether the script is running, the Tampermonkey icon will show the number of active scripts as a red number next to it. If you click the icon, the script name (questden_blick2) will show up in black, with a green switch next to it.

### Update/Disable/Delete
Tampermonkey will automatically update the script. To temporarily disable it, click the green switch next to the script name in the Tampermonkey menu to turn the font color grey. To remove the script, click on the entry and choose "Delete".
